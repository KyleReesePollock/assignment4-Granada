## IA Colophon:

	Basic Page Layout:
	Top bar
	Head
		Nav, logo, and Title
	Body
		article, images, main student content, aside
	Footer

	Page design/layout:
	We are hoping to capture a business/tech design, so this include fonts such as Garamond and or Didot. We will also be using the Z pattern to format our webpage. Color of top bar should take a light brown tone (desk wood background pic maybe?)

	Header: Nav bar top left of page. Title middle and logo top right of page.

	Body: background color, compliments brown. i.e. white or a shade of white. Body should also have boarders for the section and each student. Hyper link to go to students page as well. Mini photo on side of text.

	Navigation bar: top left or right corner, position fixed. Main pages: Home. Zubair, Jimmy, Oliver, Xiao.

	Slider: Slider should be under header above body/article content and have all four students pics. Slider is square with round edges.

	Article element should be centered on the page. Borders around each student description/miniprofile. Article has two columns and four rows. Left column are for pictures of student. Right column for students brief into and page link.

	Footer: Should be at bottom of page. centered.

	Individual business pages:

	top doc/links/header

	Consistent with home page style design.

	Student’s profile pic under header above body/article content.

	In article—> h2 (under pic.) Student’s name should be one color and major in italic and in another color.

	Put list next to picture of Grad Year and Home Town.

	Aside element and body content(article) will have sections/boarders to help separate and organize. This can be at the bottom of article or do two columns on body one for article and the other for aside. But give article more type room compared to aside.

	footer. centered. bottom of page.

	Individual CS page:

	Same format design as business pages, but a few differences. Invert background body color and font text color.

	top doc/links/header

	Consistent with home page style design with mentioned difference. Student’s profile pic under header above body content.

	In article h2 under pic. Student’s name should be one color and major another color but different color from business profiles.

	List next to picture of Grad Year and Home Town.

	aside element and body content(article) will have sections/boarders to help separate and organize

	footer. centered. bottom of page.

	Contacts:
	So for the web form I was thinking of making a comments page. Where students can put their info and give answer some question relating to our website such as what is your major. So we'll be using radio box to ask if they are a comp sci major or econ major or neither. If neither they are given the option to put their major. Relevant to our student comparison as one student is a com sci major and the rest are econ majors. Font should be consistent with home page. This content will be in the body of our home page. The aside element will have a thank you note and link back to home page after submission.

	top doc/links/header

	Consistent with home page style design. Student’s profile pic under header above body content.

	Aside element will be at the very bottom, for user to go back to homepage: Entry will pop up at the bottom of the page.

	footer. centered. bottom of page.

### Color Choices

Navbar is brown as was designated by the IA. I searched online for good combinations for brown, and purple was deemed to be a good compliment. I used a purple gradient as the background of the website. The pure white on the articles and asides was a little too harsh on the eyes, so I switched it to a soft pinkish white, which goes with the brown and purple tones of the website while also improving readability. I also made Xiao Cheng's name and major a subtle purple color on the index page and Xiao's page, respectively, as designated by the IA.

### Design Principles

- **Contrast**: I used different and modern sans-serif fonts for Xiao (computer science), while using Didot, a serif font that is more business than modern, for the Economics majors. I also inverted the gradient on the background of Xiao's pages as requested by the IA.
- **Repetition**: All aspects of the three Economics students are identical, while Xiao's background color is inverted and fonts are different to make her stand out.
- **Alignment**:All headers are left-aligned within a center-aligned article and aside. All text is left-aligned, as well.
- **Proximity**: On the index page Xiao's section (article) is separate from the other three students (aside). This difference in proximity immedietly makes her stand out to a first time visitor. White space is also used between articles and asides.

**Typefaces**
- Ubuntu is used for Banner text and Xiao's headers. Ubuntu is a modern sans-serif font that lends itself well to a tech theme. Roboto was used for the main text of Xiao's sections, it is also a modern sans-serif font that is a little less fancy than Ubuntu, so it is more readable and better for lots of text. Didot was used for the Economics majors, as it is a serif font that lends itself to a business theme while looking much better than Times and Garamond. I used larger fonts for banner text and headers.

**Layout** - CSS grid layout was used as implemented by the previous team. I feel that the grid layout lends itself well to the webpage, as well as making it easier for me to create breaks in proximity (such as on the index page) in order to highlight Xiao from the rest of the students.
