	Basic Page Layout:
	Top bar
	Head
		Nav, logo, and Title
	Body
		article, images, main student content, aside
	Footer

	Page design/layout: 
	We are hoping to capture a business/tech design, so this include fonts such as Garamond and or Didot. We will also be using the Z pattern to format our webpage. Color of top bar should take a light brown tone (desk wood background pic maybe?) 

	Header: Nav bar top left of page. Title middle and logo top right of page.

	Body: background color, compliments brown. i.e. white or a shade of white. Body should also have boarders for the section and each student. Hyper link to go to students page as well. Mini photo on side of text. 

	Navigation bar: top left or right corner, position fixed. Main pages: Home. Zubir, Jimmy, Oliver, Xiao. 

	Slider: Slider should be under header above body/article content and have all four students pics. Slider is square with round edges. 

	Article element should be centered on the page. Borders around each student description/miniprofile. Article has two columns and four rows. Left column are for pictures of student. Right column for students brief into and page link.

	Footer: Should be at bottom of page. centered. 

	Individual business pages: 

	top doc/links/header

	Consistent with home page style design.

	Student’s profile pic under header above body/article content. 

	In article—> h2 (under pic.) Student’s name should be one color and major in italic and in another color. 

	Put list next to picture of Grad Year and Home Town.

	Aside element and body content(article) will have sections/boarders to help separate and organize. This can be at the bottom of article or do two columns on body one for article and the other for aside. But give article more type room compared to aside. 

	footer. centered. bottom of page. 

	Individual CS page:

	Same format design as business pages, but a few differences. Invert background body color and font text color. 

	top doc/links/header

	Consistent with home page style design with mentioned difference. Student’s profile pic under header above body content. 

	In article h2 under pic. Student’s name should be one color and major another color but different color from business profiles. 

	List next to picture of Grad Year and Home Town.

	aside element and body content(article) will have sections/boarders to help separate and organize

	footer. centered. bottom of page. 

	Contacts: 
	So for the web form I was thinking of making a comments page. Where students can put their info and give answer some question relating to our website such as what is your major. So we'll be using radio box to ask if they are a com sci manjor or econ major or neither. If neither they are given the option to put their major. Relevent to our student comparison as one student is a com sci major and the rest are econ majors. Font should be consistent with home page. This content will be in the body of our home page. The aside element will have a thank you note and link back to home page after submission. 

	top doc/links/header

	Consistent with home page style design. Student’s profile pic under header above body content. 

	Aside element will be at the very bottom, for user to go back to homepage: Entry will pop up at the bottom of the page. 

	footer. centered. bottom of page.
