			<p>My name is Xiao Cheng, and my friends all call me Katherine/Kat. I am currently studying at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Philosophy. Comparing to other CS students, my progress is kind of slower, because I transferred to this major in my Sophomore year. Originally, I was considering majoring in Audio and Music Engineering. The reasons why I changed my major were complicated, but mostly because AME was not something I thought it would be. After taking several CS classes, I realized that I am really interested in UI/UX design, 3D modeling, game design, and front-end stuffs. I enjoy seeing the beautiful results that my work turned out to be. I guess I am more of a visual person anyways. <a class="readmore" href = "xiao.php">Read More </a></p><!---insert about me-->

			<p>I am currently a junior, anticipated to graduate in May, 2019. I started off my first year in college majoring in Economics. I had the privilege to enroll in some interesting courses in the department, such as Sports Economics, where we tested out various economic theories in a sports setting, and Econometrics where students are taught how to use the tools that enable us to extract useful information about important economic policy from a set of available data.<a class="readmore" href = "zubair.php"> Read More</a></p><!---insert about me-->

			<p>My name is Oliver Ostriker and I am a junior at the University of Rochester majoring in Financial Economics with minors in both Business and Computer Science. I am originally from Greenwich, Connecticut where I attended Greenwich High School. In High School, I really enjoyed an AP Economics course that I took, and therefore decided I wanted to major in something economics related. Because of this, I came across the University of Rochester which happened to have an incredible economics program. In addition, I had an uncle who lived in Rochester and a sister attending the school, so overall the U of R seemed like a great fit.<a class="readmore" href = "oliver.php"> Read More</a></p><!---insert small about me-->
